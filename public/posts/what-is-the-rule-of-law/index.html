			<p>In 1945, the United Nations was created on three pillars: international peace and security, human rights and development. Almost seventy-five years later, the complex political, social and economic transformation of modern society has brought us challenges and opportunities which require a collective response which must be guided by the rule of law, as it is the foundation of friendly and equitable relations between states and the base of fairs societies.</p>

<h2 id="new-vision-for-the-rule-of-law">New Vision for the Rule of Law</h2>
<p>One of the proposals in Our Common Agenda was the development of a New Vision for the Rule of Law, which, in the words of the Secretary-General, would put people at the center of justice systems. The Secretary-General tasked the Rule of Law Unit, in collaboration with the Global Focal Point for the Rule of Law and the Office of Legal Affairs, to develop this New Vision for the work of the Organization.</p>
