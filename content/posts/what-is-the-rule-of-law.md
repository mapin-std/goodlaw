In 1945, the United Nations was created on three pillars: international peace and security, human rights and development.

The Secretary-General tasked the Rule of Law Unit, in collaboration with the Global Focal Point for the Rule of Law and the Office of Legal Affairs, to develop this New Vision for the work of the Organization.
